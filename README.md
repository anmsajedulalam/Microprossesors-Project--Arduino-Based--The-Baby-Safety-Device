# The Baby Safety Device
 
 In this project, there was a sonar sensor for detecting distance, an Arduino, some jump wires, some LEDs, bread boards, registers, a buzzer and an LCD display. The sonar sensor will detect the distance of the baby and will monitor of the baby constantly. If anything goes wrong, the buzzer will make sound, LEDs will turn on and the urgent messages will be shown in the LCD display.
